## Module pyspacemouse

The module-level API is as follows:

    open(callback=None, button_callback=None, button_callback_arr=None, set_nonblocking_loop=True, device=None)
        Open a 3D space navigator device. Makes this device the current active device, which enables the module-level read() and close()
        calls. For multiple devices, use the read() and close() calls on the returned object instead, and don't use the module-level calls.

        Parameters:
            callback: If callback is provided, it is called on each HID update with a copy of the current state namedtuple
            dof_callback: If dof_callback is provided, it is called only on DOF state changes with the argument (state).
            button_callback: If button_callback is provided, it is called on each button push, with the arguments (state_tuple, button_state)
            device: name of device to open, as a string like "SpaceNavigator". Must be one of the values in `supported_devices`.
                    If `None`, chooses the first supported device found.
        Returns:
            Device object if the device was opened successfully
            None if the device could not be opened

    read()              Return a namedtuple giving the current device state (t,x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,button)
    close()             Close the connection to the current device, if it is open
    list_devices()      Return a list of supported devices found, or an empty list if none found

`open()` returns a DeviceSpec object.
If you have multiple 3Dconnexion devices, you can use the object-oriented API to access them individually.
Each object has the following API, which functions exactly as the above API, but on a per-device basis:

    dev.open()          Opens the connection (this is always called by the module-level open command,
                        so you should not need to use it unless you have called close())
    dev.read()          Return the state of the device as namedtuple [t,x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,button]
    dev.close()         Close this device

There are also attributes:

    dev.connected       True if the device is connected, False otherwise
    dev.state           Convenience property which returns the same value as read()

## State objects

State objects returned from `read()` have 7 attributes: [t,x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,button].

* t: timestamp in seconds since the script started.
* x,y,z: translations in the range [-1.0, 1.0]
* roll, pitch, yaw: rotations in the range [-1.0, 1.0].
* button: list of button states (0 or 1), in order specified in the device specifier
